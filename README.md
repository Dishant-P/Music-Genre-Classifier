# Music-Genre-Classifier

## Research abstract
The extraction of spectral features from a music
clip is a computationally expensive task. As in order to extract
accurate features, we need to process the clip for its whole length.
This preprocessing task creates a large overhead and also makes
the extraction process slower. We show how formatting a dataset
in a certain way, can help make the process more efficient by
eliminating the need for processing the clip for its whole duration,
and still extract the features accurately. In addition, we discuss
the possibility of defining set generic durations for analyzing a
certain type of music clip while training. And in doing so we cut
down the need of processing the clip duration to just 10% of the
global average.
